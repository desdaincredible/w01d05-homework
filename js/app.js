// A. Q + A
// How do we assign a value to a variable?
//const variableName = variableValue

// How do we change the value of a variable?
//variable needs to start as let variableName = versus const
//then we write let variableName = newValue

// How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
// let existingVariable = newVariable

// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
//declare is the first time you tell the program to create a 
//variable or function
//assign is when you give a variable a new value
//define is the first time you give a variable a value

// What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
//Pseudocoding is writing out in plain English the steps you 
//want to take to achieve a goal. It is useful because it allows
//you to think through a problem before jumping into code. That
//way you can double check that each of your steps is being 
//accomplished when you test your code.

// What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how 
//you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code 
//to solve it?
//75% - 90% of your time should be planning and 10%-25% should
//be typing code.
